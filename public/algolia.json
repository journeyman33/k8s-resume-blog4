A Civo managed Kubernetes cluster costs less than half of the the price of any of the three hyperscalers EKS, AKS and GKE, and being a dedicated Kubernetes cloud provider, running a lightweight version of Kubernetes (k3s), the set up times are super fast. This means, for a developer, it is cost effective in a second sense: you can start up a cluster and then shut it down each time you work on it.","tags":null,"title":"Cloud Architectural Overview","type":"post","url":"/post/readme/","weight":0,"wordcount":651},{"author":null,"categories":["Tech"],"content":"","date":1711324800,"description":"","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":"","excerpt_text":"","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":800,"html":"","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1711324800,"objectID":"db9cd5a54a71760773c01c72295e12b1","permalink":"/post/week_four/","publishdate":"2024-03-25T00:00:00Z","readingtime":4,"relpermalink":"/post/week_four/","section":"post","summary":"Extra Credit Three tasks were suggested here: Package Everything in Helm Implement Persistent Storage Implement Basic CI/CD Pipeline Make use of Serverless 2 Persistent Storage When the mysql deployment pods go down due to restarts, updates, or scaling the data is lost.
