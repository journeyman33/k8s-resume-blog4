      <description>Extra Credit Three tasks were suggested here: Package Everything in Helm Implement Persistent Storage Implement Basic CI/CD Pipeline Make use of Serverless 2 Persistent Storage When the mysql deployment pods go down due to restarts, updates, or scaling the data is lost. Therefore we want to persist the contents of the container directory /var/lib/mysql with outside storage.&#xA;kubectl get storageclass -oyaml&#xA;apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1 kind: StorageClass metadata: name: civo-volume provisioner: csi.civo.com reclaimPolicy: Delete volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer The presence of a StorageClass configuration indicates that Civo Cloud offers a default persistent storage solution to dynamically provision storage with PVs (Persistent volumes) and PVC&amp;rsquo;s (Persistent Volume Claims).</description>

      <description>Step 6: Implement Configuration Management Task: Add a feature toggle to the web application to enable a “dark mode” for the website. I first attempted this without reading the instructions carefully. It does not ask to create a physical day night switch on the web app to toggle between dark mode and light mode, but rather to create a kubernetes config map to toggle the settings with the default set to dark mode.</description>

      <description>Step 3: Set Up Kubernetes on a Public Cloud Provider Since it takes less than 2 minutes this is and easy first step. This command being the final iteration:&#xA;civo kubernetes create ecom –remove-applications=traefik2-nodeport –applications traefik2-loadbalancer,cert-manager –cni-plugin cilium --nodes 1 --size g4s.kube.medium create-firewall –wait –save –merge –switch&#xA;You can interact with Civo in three ways:&#xA;The Dashboard Civo CLI Terraform I used the CLI. I was able to set up a bash script to automate the next step of exposing the cluster to https, Traefic LoadBalancer and cert-manager shown in the scripts section of my code-repository https://github.</description>

      <description>Step 1: Certification The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) course is a great resource. Also from Kodekloud, the Ultimate Certified Kubernetes CKAD mock exams was what I enjoyed the most. I completed the CKA on 26 may 2021 and the CKS on 18 Nov 2021. Step 2: Containerize Your E-Commerce Website and Database A. Web Application Containerization The first step was to set up civo and kubectl cli client running on ubuntu Windows WSL running with Docker Desktop installed.</description>
